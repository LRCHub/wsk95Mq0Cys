If I got a two small cheeks
and a bright pink lips
Baby,
would you’ve wanted to kiss me?
Maybe a thin ass waist
with a brown long hair
Baby,
would you’ve wanted to hold me?
No, you never
No, I’m never
gonna get them all
Yeah, that’s what makes
me feel lonely
Oh, it’s never
It can never ever happen to me
Cause I’m that girl, tall girle
-
Boy, I got a small girl fantasy
Baby, would you still love me?
Though I got a big laugh
big voice and big personality
Would you guarantee it?
Know you got
a small girl fantasy
Baby, would you still love me?
Though I got a big laugh
big voice and big personality
Would you guarantee?
(If I got a, if I got a)
Would you guarantee?
(If I got a, if I got a)
Would you guarantee?
(If I got a, if I got a)
If I cared about
all those things that you care
Then I’m not yours
Yes,
you’re wasting all your time
for some stupid things
Baby, I’m already yours
You keep asking me
"Do I really suit you?"
"Do I really look good?"
Girl, I don’t undеrstand you
All you have to do
is smiling at me like
there’s no one to interrupt us
Cause that’s
all I need from you
Make that fingers V
수줍어 하지 말고
가까이 더 붙어
난 여기있어
니가 뭘 원하던지간에
난 항상 똑같아
다른 조건은 애초에 없었어
(well)
Big eyes, Big laugh
Big voice or Big personality
Girl, I don’t got no fantasy
There’s no more other fantasy
(yeah,yeah)
