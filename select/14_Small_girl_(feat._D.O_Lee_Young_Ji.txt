If I got a two small cheeks and a bright pink lips
Baby, would you wanted to kiss me?
Maybe a thin ass waist with brown a long hair
Baby, would you wanted to hold me? No, you never
No, I'm never gonna get 'em all
Yeah, that's what makes me feel lonely, oh, it's never
It can never ever happen to me 'cause I'm that girl, tall girly

Boy, I got a small girl fantasy
Baby, would you still love me?
Though I got a big laugh, big voice, and big personality
Would you guarantee?

Know you got a small girl fantasy
Baby, would you still love me?
Though I got a big laugh, big voice, and big personality
Would you guarantee?

(If I got a)
(If I got a) would you guarantee?
(If-if I got a)
(If I got a) would you guarantee?
(If-if I got a)
(If-if I got a)

If I care about all those things that you care, then I'm not yours
Yes, you're wastin' all your time for some stupid things, baby, I'm already yours
You keep askin' me, "Do I really suit you? Do I really look good?"
Girl, I don't understand you
All you have to do is smilin' at me like there's no one interrupt us
'Cause that's all I need from you

Make that fingers, V
수줍어하지 말고 가까이 더 붙어, 난 여기 있어
네가 뭘 원하든지 간에 난 항상 똑같아
다른 조건은 애초에 없었어, will

Big eyes, big laugh, big voice, or big personality
Girl, I don't got no fantasy
There's no more other fantasy, yeah-yeah

If I got a two small cheeks and a bright pink lips
